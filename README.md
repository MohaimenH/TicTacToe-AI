# TicTacToe in Python 

This is my first attempt at making a game in python.
It will be a basic TicTacToe game played on the console.

Currently there is the skeleton in place. I will be implementing a simple AI to play against very soon. 
Right now the game supports two players randomly scribbling until the game reaches nine moves. 
A checker to see if the game is over or not is being implemented.
